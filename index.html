	<h2>Telegram Group Humor</h2>
	<p>So, my friend and I decided to start a Telegram group to work on projects and become freelancers. We thought it would be a great way to collaborate and share ideas. </p>
	<p>But, let's be honest, the real reason we started the group was so we could send each other memes and jokes during the workday.</p>
	<p>Our group chat quickly became a mix of coding talk and humorous banter. In fact, we even started a weekly "Worst Code of the Week" contest to see who could come up with the most convoluted, unreadable code.</p>
	<p>Despite all the jokes and distractions, we managed to stay focused enough to complete a few projects and even landed a few freelance gigs. Who knew that a little bit of humor could be such a great motivator?</p>
	<p>Although, I'm pretty sure our clients don't want to know how many memes we sent each other during the project...</p>
